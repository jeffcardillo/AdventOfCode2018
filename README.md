# AdventOfCode2018

I have been participating in Advent of Code 2018 (https://adventofcode.com/). I'm doing it for fun and to sharpen my skills with Kotlin; a language I want to get more familiar with.

Under the src directory you will see the code broken out in to each day's puzzle. Each day's folder will have a screenshot of the puzzle itself, the input file used by the code, and the source file(s).

All solutions are my own, for better or worse. My solutions aren't always optimized because I have a toddler running around and I'm  often grateful to just be able to see a puzzle through to the end.
